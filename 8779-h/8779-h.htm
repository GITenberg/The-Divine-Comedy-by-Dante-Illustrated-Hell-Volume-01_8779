<br><br>
<a href="images/01-002.jpg"><img alt="01-002b.jpg (60K)" src="images/01-002b.jpg" height="544" width="360"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>
IN the midway of this our mortal life,<br>
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell<br>
It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,<br>
Which to remember only, my dismay<br>
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br>
Yet to discourse of what there good befell,<br>
All else will I relate discover'd there.<br>
How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br>
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd<br>
My senses down, when the true path I left,<br>
But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br>
The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,<br>
I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad<br>
Already vested with that planet's beam,<br>
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.<br>
<br>Then was a little respite to the fear,<br>
That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br>
All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:<br>
And as a man, with difficult short breath,<br>
Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br>
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd<br>
Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br>
That none hath pass'd and liv'd. &nbsp;My weary frame<br>
After short pause recomforted, again<br>
I journey'd on over that lonely steep,<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-005.jpg"><img alt="01-005b.jpg (56K)" src="images/01-005b.jpg" height="414" width="488"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
The hinder foot still firmer. &nbsp;Scarce the ascent<br>
Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,<br>
And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,<br>
Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove<br>
To check my onward going; that ofttimes<br>
With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.<br>
<br>The hour was morning's prime, and on his way<br>
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,<br>
That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd<br>
Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope<br>
All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin<br>
Of that swift animal, the matin dawn<br>
And the sweet season. &nbsp;Soon that joy was chas'd,<br>
And by new dread succeeded, when in view<br>
A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-007.jpg"><img alt="01-007b.jpg (38K)" src="images/01-007b.jpg" height="541" width="350"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,<br>
That e'en the air was fear-struck. &nbsp;A she-wolf<br>
Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd<br>
Full of all wants, and many a land hath made<br>
Disconsolate ere now. &nbsp;She with such fear<br>
O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,<br>
That of the height all hope I lost. &nbsp;As one,<br>
Who with his gain elated, sees the time<br>
When all unwares is gone, he inwardly<br>
Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,<br>
Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,<br>
Who coming o'er against me, by degrees<br>
Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.<br>
<br>While to the lower space with backward step<br>
I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,<br>
Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.<br>
When him in that great desert I espied,<br>
"Have mercy on me!" &nbsp;cried I out aloud,<br>
"Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!"<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Now not man, man once I was,<br>
And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both<br>
By country, when the power of Julius yet<br>
Was scarcely firm. &nbsp;At Rome my life was past<br>
Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time<br>
Of fabled deities and false. &nbsp;A bard<br>
Was I, and made Anchises' upright son<br>
The subject of my song, who came from Troy,<br>
When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.<br>
But thou, say wherefore to such perils past<br>
Return'st thou? &nbsp;wherefore not this pleasant mount<br>
Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?"<br>
"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,<br>
From which such copious floods of eloquence<br>
Have issued?" &nbsp;I with front abash'd replied.<br>
"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!<br>
May it avail me that I long with zeal<br>
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense<br>
Have conn'd it o'er. &nbsp;My master thou and guide!<br>
Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd<br>
That style, which for its beauty into fame<br>
Exalts me. &nbsp;See the beast, from whom I fled.<br>
O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-011.jpg"><img alt="01-011b.jpg (50K)" src="images/01-011b.jpg" height="535" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame<br>
She hath made tremble." &nbsp;He, soon as he saw<br>
That I was weeping, answer'd, "Thou must needs<br>
Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape<br>
From out that savage wilderness. &nbsp;This beast,<br>
At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none<br>
To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:<br>
So bad and so accursed in her kind,<br>
That never sated is her ravenous will,<br>
Still after food more craving than before.<br>
To many an animal in wedlock vile<br>
She fastens, and shall yet to many more,<br>
Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy<br>
Her with sharp pain. &nbsp;He will not life support<br>
By earth nor its base metals, but by love,<br>
Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be<br>
The land 'twixt either Feltro. &nbsp;In his might<br>
Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,<br>
For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,<br>
Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.<br>
He with incessant chase through every town<br>
Shall worry, until he to hell at length<br>
Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.<br>
I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,<br>
That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide<br>
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,<br>
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see<br>
Spirits of old tormented, who invoke<br>
A second death; and those next view, who dwell<br>
Content in fire, for that they hope to come,<br>
Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,<br>
Into whose regions if thou then desire<br>
T' ascend, a spirit worthier then I<br>
Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,<br>
Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,<br>
Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,<br>
Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,<br>
That to his city none through me should come.<br>
He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds<br>
His citadel and throne. &nbsp;O happy those,<br>
Whom there he chooses!" I to him in few:<br>
"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,<br>
I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse<br>
I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,<br>
That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those<br>
Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."<br>
<br>Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>NOW was the day departing, and the air,<br>
Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd<br>
All animals on earth; and I alone<br>
Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,<br>
Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,<br>
Which my unerring memory shall retrace.<br>
<br>O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe<br>
Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept<br>
Safe in a written record, here thy worth<br>
And eminent endowments come to proof.<br>
<br>I thus began: "Bard! thou who art my guide,<br>
Consider well, if virtue be in me<br>
Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise<br>
Thou trust me. &nbsp;Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,<br>
Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among<br>
Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there<br>
Sensible present. &nbsp;Yet if heaven's great Lord,<br>
Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,<br>
In contemplation of the high effect,<br>
Both what and who from him should issue forth,<br>
It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:<br>
Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,<br>
In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:<br>
Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd<br>
And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits<br>
Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.<br>
He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,<br>
Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise<br>
And to the papal robe. &nbsp;In after-times<br>
The chosen vessel also travel'd there,<br>
To bring us back assurance in that faith,<br>
Which is the entrance to salvation's way.<br>
But I, why should I there presume? &nbsp;or who<br>
Permits it? &nbsp;not, Aeneas I nor Paul.<br>
Myself I deem not worthy, and none else<br>
Will deem me. &nbsp;I, if on this voyage then<br>
I venture, fear it will in folly end.<br>
Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,<br>
Than I can speak." &nbsp;As one, who unresolves<br>
What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts<br>
Changes his purpose, from his first intent<br>
Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,<br>
Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first<br>
So eagerly embrac'd. &nbsp;"If right thy words<br>
I scan," replied that shade magnanimous,<br>
"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft<br>
So overcasts a man, that he recoils<br>
From noblest resolution, like a beast<br>
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.<br>
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,<br>
I will instruct thee why I came, and what<br>
I heard in that same instant, when for thee<br>
Grief touch'd me first. &nbsp;I was among the tribe,<br>
Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest<br>
And lovely, I besought her to command,<br>
Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star<br>
Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft<br>
Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:<br>
"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame<br>
Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!<br>
A friend, not of my fortune but myself,<br>
On the wide desert in his road has met<br>
Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.<br>
Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,<br>
And I be ris'n too late for his relief,<br>
From what in heaven of him I heard. &nbsp;Speed now,<br>
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,<br>
And by all means for his deliverance meet,<br>
Assist him. &nbsp;So to me will comfort spring.<br>
I who now bid thee on this errand forth<br>
Am Beatrice; from a place I come.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-021.jpg"><img alt="02-021b.jpg (45K)" src="images/02-021b.jpg" height="537" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>(Note: Beatrice. &nbsp;I use this word, as it is<br>
pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four<br>
syllables, of which the third is a long one.)</p>

<p>Revisited with joy. &nbsp;Love brought me thence,<br>
Who prompts my speech. &nbsp;When in my Master's sight<br>
I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell."<br>
<br>She then was silent, and I thus began:<br>
"O Lady! by whose influence alone,<br>
Mankind excels whatever is contain'd<br>
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,<br>
So thy command delights me, that to obey,<br>
If it were done already, would seem late.<br>
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;<br>
Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth<br>
To leave that ample space, where to return<br>
Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath."<br>
<br>She then: "Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,<br>
I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread<br>
Hinders my entrance here. &nbsp;Those things alone<br>
Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,<br>
None else, for none are terrible beside.<br>
I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!<br>
That any suff'rance of your misery<br>
Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire<br>
Assails me. &nbsp;In high heaven a blessed dame<br>
Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief<br>
That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,<br>
That God's stern judgment to her will inclines."<br>
To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:<br>
"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid<br>
And I commend him to thee." &nbsp;At her word<br>
Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,<br>
And coming to the place, where I abode<br>
Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,<br>
She thus address'd me: "Thou true praise of God!<br>
Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent<br>
To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave<br>
For thy sake all the multitude admires?<br>
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,<br>
Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,<br>
Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?"<br>
Ne'er among men did any with such speed<br>
Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,<br>
As when these words were spoken, I came here,<br>
Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force<br>
Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all<br>
Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings."<br>
<br>"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes<br>
Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt<br>
Redoubled zeal to serve thee. &nbsp;As she will'd,<br>
Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,<br>
Who thy near way across the goodly mount<br>
Prevented. &nbsp;What is this comes o'er thee then?<br>
Why, why dost thou hang back? &nbsp;why in thy breast<br>
Harbour vile fear? &nbsp;why hast not courage there<br>
And noble daring? &nbsp;Since three maids so blest<br>
Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;<br>
And so much certain good my words forebode."<br>
<br>As florets, by the frosty air of night<br>
Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,<br>
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;<br>
So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,<br>
And to my heart such kindly courage ran,<br>
That I as one undaunted soon replied:<br>
"O full of pity she, who undertook<br>
My succour! and thou kind who didst perform<br>
So soon her true behest!  With such desire<br>
Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,<br>
That my first purpose fully is resum'd.<br>
Lead on: one only will is in us both.<br>
Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord."<br>
<br>So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,<br>
I enter'd on the deep and woody way.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
